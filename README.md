ðŸš€ LAB-1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization in Python

â—¾ LAB 1 ipnyb file consists of the basic python coding required to perform the EDA on a given data set and find the insights from a particular dataset. This code files uses the Titanic.csv dataset file to perform the EDA and Visualizes the results using matplotlib and seaborn libraries. 



ðŸš€ LAB-2: Data Pre-processing

â—¾ LAB 2 ipnyb file consists of the basic python coding required to perform the Data Pre-processing methods which includes handling the missing/unrequired values, extracting indepentend and dependent variables, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and features scaling of the data. This code files uses the Data.csv dataset file to perform the Data Pre-processing methods.
